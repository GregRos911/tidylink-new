# TidyLink

🔗 Live demo: https://tidylink-project.netlify.app/

TidyLink is a URL shortener and link verification platform built with TypeScript, Clerk authentication, and Supabase as the backend. It enables users to create shortened links and eventually a “verified” badge and manage them via a clean dashboard UI. I am currently still working on te project, so I have not gotten tot that phase yet.

This project is currently in development and intended to showcase code structure, modern stack usage, and low-code AI integration for job applications and portfolio review.

## ⚙️ Core Features

- 🔐 Authentication via Clerk
- 🔗 Create and manage clean, verified short links and QR Codes
- 📊 Usage tracking and analytics dashboard (in progress)
- 🧩 Built using TypeScript + Tailwind CSS for maintainable and responsive code

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)  
- **Authentication:** Clerk  
- **Architecture:** Component-based, low-code UI principles

## 📁 Code Overview

- `components/`: Reusable UI components  
- `pages/`: Main route views (e.g., dashboard, login)  
- `utils/`: Utility functions and Supabase/Clerk config  
- `styles/`: Tailwind-based styling and global config

## 🙋‍♂️ Purpose

This project is not intended for installation at this time. It is shared publicly to demonstrate proficiency in full-stack development using modern tools, particularly in building low-code platforms and user-friendly dashboards.This is still development mode at this time. If you need access to the direct project, please reach out and I will provide the credentials for access.
